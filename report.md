# Report 

## This is the report of the issues during making the program

It took me a lot of time and effort to build this program. The hardest part was combining all the previously learned topics into one project.
Luckily, by the help of internet and colleagues, it all become more manageable. I found out there are is an increadible amount of information on the internet which 
can be of big help in the next projects I'll be working on.

The use of modules was something that I had to read a lot about, and the ones used will be described below.

### Argparse module
Something new in this last assignment was the use of argparse. Thanks to the internet I've found out it wasn't that hard after all.
It is a module that certainly will be very helpful in other projects.

### Datetime module
This module was less straight forward then the argpase, but after a lot of reading and searching for examples, I managed to create working functions.

### CSV module
The CSV module is a very helpful tool when working with big amounts of data. My only previous experience with CSV files where with Microsoft Excel. It is nice to know, one can use Python to write, read and open csv files.

### PDF module
This is the other non-trivial features built in the program. Thanks to 'reportlab' and its function to convert .csv files to .pdf files, the inventory of the supermarket can be exported to a .pdf file. I think it is nice that you can automatically convert the file format and have a good looking report.

### Table module
This is one of the non-trivial features built in the program. Thanks to the available documentation and the 'prettytable' module, 
I managed to show the results and outputs of the program in nicely looking tables.



#### Learned a lot!
I underestimated the amount of work that needs to be done for a 'simple' inventory program. Especially after all the previous assignments, this was a hard one!
This last assignment is a very good practice to combine all the previously learned topics and challenge you to solve all the encountered problems.
Thanks to the internet and some helpful colleagues it was fun and educational to work on this assignment.
